# The Aeternus Manifesto

## 1. Time as the only true scarcity  
Everything in the digital world can be duplicated.  
Except time.

Aeternus represents the irreversible passage of existence — not as a commodity, but as a relic.

## 2. The gift of lived years  
The creator donates not wealth, but **life already spent**.  
Each AET is a symbolic fragment of decades lived, distilled into a single artifact.

## 3. The refusal of financial logic  
Aeternus does not seek:
- speculation,
- appreciation,
- trading,
- or utility.

Its purpose is to resist the assumption that everything must become an asset.

## 4. The universal ritual  
Only one AET is offered per year, echoing the turning of time itself.  
A practice of remembrance.  
A reminder of mortality.

## 5. The question  
Not “How much is this worth?”  
but:

> **“What meaning does borrowed time carry?”**

Aeternus refuses answers.  
It offers only the question.
