# Aeternus (AET)

> “You are not buying an asset. You are accepting to carry a fragment of lived time.”

**Aeternus (AET)** is the first philosophical “time-token”, created as a conceptual artifact on the **Base** network (chainId `8453`), an Ethereum Layer 2 incubated by Coinbase.

Rather than representing financial value, Aeternus symbolizes **irreversible human time** — finite, unrepeatable, non-mintable.
