# Aeternus (AET)

> “You are not buying an asset. You are accepting to carry a fragment of lived time.”

**Aeternus (AET)** is the first philosophical “time-token”, created as a conceptual artifact on the **Base** network (chainId `8453`), an Ethereum Layer 2 incubated by Coinbase.

Rather than representing financial value, Aeternus symbolizes **irreversible human time** — finite, unrepeatable, non-mintable.

## 1. Overview

- **Token Name:** Aeternus  
- **Symbol:** AET  
- **Decimals:** 18  
- **Total Supply:** 100 AET (fixed forever)  
- **Network:** Base Mainnet (`8453`)  
- **Contract Address:**  0xED60cfFE22C9D55797b7c4e034bbD93A104B506b


Aeternus is not a financial instrument.  
It is a *philosophical artifact* exploring the relation between:

- time,
- memory,
- meaning,
- and digital permanence.

---

## 2. Philosophical Premise

Aeternus proposes a reversal of the traditional financial equation:

- Normally:  
**time → labor → money**

- In Aeternus:  
**time lived → symbol → shared existence**

The 100 AET represent an immutable set of hours, experiences, and human presence that **cannot be recreated**.

AET is not mined.  
AET is not minted.  
AET is *donated* — as an offering of life already spent.

The guiding question:

> **“What is the value of time that no longer returns?”**

- No administrator, no owner, no privileged functions
- No minting, no burning, no reconfiguration
- All supply assigned to the deployer at creation
- Pure, immutable token logic

The contract source is available at:  
[`contracts/Aeternus.sol`](contracts/Aeternus.sol)

## 4. Tokenomics (Conceptual)

- **Total supply:** 100 AET  
- **Initial holder:** the deployer  
- **Distribution philosophy:**  
- AET should not be “sold” as a commodity.  
- AET is **donated annually**, as a ritual and reminder of the passing of time.  
- Each recipient holds a symbolic fragment of someone’s lived years.

In this sense, AET behaves not like a currency, but like:

- a commemorative artifact,
- a temporal marker,
- a philosophical statement.
